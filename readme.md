circle-timer

a filled circle is emptied (countdown):
 - imagine four circles on top of another
 - each is transparent except for a 90 degree wedge which is opaque
 - the opaque wedge of each circle is in a different quadrant
   - moving up from the bottom of the stack of circles they are in quadrants I, IV, III, and II
   - the circle appears entirely filled at the start
 - countdown begins and the top circle (quadrant II) spins counter clockwise 90 degrees
   - when it aligns, the next wedge begins rotating in the same direction
   - the first circle could be removed
